        <h1> Negabinary </h1>
        <p> Hi, I'm Matt, and I'm obsessed with using the <a href=http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable>new medium</a> to make they way we think about mathematics, statistics and everything else easier.</p>

        <p> Here are some of my projects and musings: </p>
        
        <div class=section>
            <h2> Doing Maths on Computers </h2>
            <p class=dream> <b>The dream</b> - watch the video: </p>
            
            <video width="320" height="180" controls preload="none" muted style="margin:auto; display:block">
                <source src="/images/videos/Dream.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                The video is broken :/
            </video>
            
            <p class=dream> Pencil and paper is still the best way to do mathematical working. I think we should be able to do better with the interactivity afforded to us by computers.</p>
            
            <h3> Prototype </h3>
            <p> An implementation of some of the features from the video. It's not as beginner-friendly as I'm aiming for, but I'm learning a lot from making it. </p>

            <h3> More thoughts </h3>
            <p> <a href=/posts/pencil-and-paper.html> What's wrong with doing maths on pencil and paper?</a> </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class=section>
            <h2> Probability </h2>
            <p> Try this problem: </p>
            
            <p class=quote> Three scientific studies are beings set up - the first (i) is recruiting two-child families where "the oldest sibling is a daughter", the second (ii) recruiting two-child familites where "one of the children is a daughter" and the third (iii) recruiting two-child families where "one of the children is a daughter that was born on a Wednesday". </p>
            
            <p class=quote> What is the probability that the other child is a boy in each study? </p>
            
            <p> People always struggle to believe that the answer to (iii) is different to (ii). Probability is hard.</p>
            
            <p class=dream> <b>The dream</b> - to make a general-purpose visual programming language for modelling probabalistic scenarios. Given that a model is just a story, we let the user draw a story board and have the computer calculate the probabilities, instead of having to apply Bayesian calculations themeselves.
                
            <h3> Summer Research Project </h3>
            
            <p> I did a summer research project in the summer of 2021 very similar to this. I will add details here as soon as they are published. </p>

        <div class=section>
            <h2> Quantum Computing </h2>
            <p class=dream> <b>The dream</b> - could it be possible to make even quantum computing intuitive with the right visual metaphors and interactions? </p>
            
            <h3> Qubits Minecraft Mod </h3>
            <p> A mod that adds Redstone-controlled qubits to Minecraft. </p>

            <h3> Quantum Kings </h3>
            <p> A game set in a medieval kingdom that is cursed with various quantum situations that aims to slowly introduce quantum concepts eventually leading up to the Deutsch-Jozsa problem. </p>

            <h2> The Bible </h2>
            <p class=dream> <b>The dream</b> - The Bible is not just a poorly organised collection of quotes, but a collection of different types of literature that make up an overarching story. I want to be able to know where in the story the quote fits and what sort of literature we're looking at.</p>
            <h3> The Old Testament </h3>
            <p> An overview of how the Old Testament books fit together. </p>

            <h2> Sandwiches </h2>
            <p class=dream> A survey about how many sandwiches you get when you cut sandwiches. </p>
